GDPR and data protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as &quot;controllers&quot;) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as &quot;processors&quot;).</p><p>The Company acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our Service. You can contact us by email at the address indicated above in the section entitled &quot;Contact Us&quot; above.</p><p>Lawful Basis For Processing. GDPR and data protection laws in Europe require a &quot;lawful basis&quot; for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include the following:</p><p>To fulfill obligations in the contract between you and the Company. To use our Service, you and the Company entered into an agreement under the Company&#39;s Terms of Use, and for the Company to fulfill its obligations with respect to providing the Service under such agreement, we have to collect your personal information to provide the necessary functionality as further described above entitled &quot;The Information We Collect About You&quot;.</p><p>To pursue our legitimate interests. We rely on legitimate interests pursued by us to process your information, including understanding how our Service is functioning, improving our Service, developing new products and preventing fraud. To pursue the foregoing, we will process personal information. Where we rely on legitimate interest, we carry out a balancing test to weigh our interests against your right to personal data protection, our processing will never override your fundamental rights and freedoms, and you can always exercise your right to object to such processing.</p><p>Consent. In certain situations where you provide us with consent, we may process your information.</p><p>To comply with law. In limited circumstances we may process information in order to comply with legal obligations. To the extent we have received such information from third parties where we have agreed to contractual requirements such as standard contractual clauses, we will use our reasonable efforts to dispute making such disclosures unless legally required to do so.</p><p>Retention Of Information. Once the purpose of processing is fulfilled, we retain personal data for no longer than the applicable statutory limitation period. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We will delete or anonymize personal data once the applicable retention period has expired. Data Transfer</p><p>If GDPR applies and your data is transferred outside UK or the EEA to the United States or any other country, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate safeguards, such as an adequacy decision by the European Commission based on article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or Standard Contractual Clauses as provided from time to time by the European Commission. You can receive additional information on where your data is transferred, and which are the appropriate safeguards by contacting us.</p><p>Your Data Subject Rights. If you are a data subject according to the GDPR, subject to certain conditions you have the right to:</p><p>access, rectify, or erase any personal data we process about you;</p><p>data portability, asking us to transfer to any third party at your choice;</p><p>restrict or object to our processing of personal data we process about you; and</p><p>where applicable, withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing.</p><p>How to Exercise Your Rights. You may exercise your rights by submitting a written request to us at the email address set out in Section 10 above entitled &quot;Contact Us&quot;. We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.</p><p>Complaints. If you have a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may submit a complaint to the Data Protection Supervisory Authority in your jurisdiction. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us.</p><p>In addition to our contact details indicated above, you can also contact our Designated Individual Overseeing Compliance of this privacy policy by emailing <a href="mailto:support@mikeshinoda.com">support@linkinpark.com</a> or writing us at: </p><p>LINKIN PARK PRIVACY POLICY</p><p>1880 Century Park E # 1600</p><p>Los Angeles, CA 90067
